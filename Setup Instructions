#Setup Instructions

##Clone the repository:

˜bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kafka-docker-sentiment-dashboard.git
cd kafka-docker-sentiment-dashboard
Set up Kafka and Zookeeper using Docker:

##Make sure Docker Desktop is running on your system.
Start the Kafka and Zookeeper containers using Docker Compose:
˜bash
docker-compose up -d
Install required Python libraries:

##Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
˜bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate


##Install dependencies:
˜bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Execution Steps
Run Kafka Producers:

##Ensure Kafka and Zookeeper are running.

##Run the producer script to start sending data (Reddit posts) to Kafka:
˜bash
python3 producer_script.py
This will start sending Reddit data to the Kafka topic.
Run the Consumer Script:

##Run the consumer script to consume data from Kafka and process the sentiment:
˜bash
python3 consumer_script.py
Real-time Sentiment Analysis:

###The consumer script will process the data, perform sentiment analysis, and print out the results (or store them in a data structure or database).
You can modify the consumer script to visualize or export the analysis results (e.g., using matplotlib for visualizing the sentiment scores).

Additional Notes
You can modify the Kafka producer to pull data from any subreddit by adjusting the Reddit API URL and parameters.
The sentiment analysis model can be customized to improve accuracy by training on more specific datasets.
